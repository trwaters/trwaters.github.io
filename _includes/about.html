    <h3 class="mb2">About Me</h3>
    <p>
      I’m currently a postdoc in the Theoretical Division at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). 
      I was formerly a postdoc at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) working in Daniel Proga's group.
      <br><br>
      I specialize in modeling the UV and X-ray dominated environments of active galactic nuclei (actively accreting supermassive black holes in distant galaxies) 
      and low-mass X-ray binaries (the stellar mass black holes observed in our own galaxy). 
      I’m especially interested in developing computational models that are realistic enough to be used to produce synthetic spectra, 
      so that a direct comparison with observational data can be made. As of now, I am mainly focused on trying to explain
      phenomena associated with the field of X-ray astronomy, but I'm also very interested in AGN reverberation mapping, 
      a field that is mainly based on optical and UV observations.

      Much of my work involves solving the equations of non-adiabatic hydrodynamics or magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) numerically.  
      For this, I mainly use the code <a href='https://princetonuniversity.github.io/athena/'>Athena++</a>,
      although I sometimes also use <a href='https://gitlab.com/pgrete/kathena'>K-Athena</a>, 
      a GPU code based on Athena++ that is built using <a href='https://github.com/kokkos'>Kokkos</a>.

      On my <a href="{{ site.nav.main.projects }}">projects</a> page, I list links to any research projects for which I've created accompanying webpages.
      <!-- &mdash;mostly those where we've needed to run hydro simulations.-->  
      Besides showcasing how my animation tools have evolved over the years, it serves to illustrate how two very different modeling approaches &mdash; local simulations to better understand multiphase gas dynamics and global accretion&#8725;outflow simulations to probe large scale dynamics &mdash; are now beginning to come together.
