    The X-ray sky is filled with millions of bright point sources that we know to be hot plasma accreting onto supermassive 
    black holes.  At light year distances from the black hole, the atmosphere of the accretion disk is irradiated by the 
    central X-rays and heated to high enough temperatures to drive a wind.  Here we model the dynamics of this system, 
    identifying a characteristic radius where the wind becomes multiphase due to classical thermal instability operating 
    within large scale vortices present in the upper layers of the disk atmosphere.

  description: |
    Observations of AGN outflows reveal them to be clumpy.  Here is the first ever demonstration that 
    classical thermal instability can be triggered in an outflow, which may ultimately explain such observations.  
    This project was led by PhD student Randall Dannen and was the subject of both a 
    <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/why-clouds-form-near-black-holes/" target="_blank">NASA press release</a>  
    and <a href="https://www.unlv.edu/news/accomplishments/randall-dannen" target="_blank">a UNLV highlight</a>.

  date: "2020"
  description: |
    A classic solution in astrophysical gas dynamics is spherically symmetric accretion onto a black hole.  
    Despite being a highly idealized solution, one would not expect an infintesimal change in the boundary
    conditions to result in a qualitatively different solution.  Yet that is precisely what happens: a tiny
    density inhomogeneity placed far enough away from the black hole will not permit pure inflow.  We demonstrated
    that an outflow must develop as a consequence of angular momentum conservation.  
    More generally, we showed that solutions to the 'inhomogenous Bondi problem' must satisfy the integral condition shown at left.

- name: "Calculations of radiation forces in AGN"
  date: "2019"
  description: |
    There is a famous characteristic luminosity in astrophysics known as the Eddington limit, which is the luminosity
    that would give rise to a radiation force equal to the force of gravity, allowing gas to levitate at this limit and
    get pushed outward above it. The Eddington limit applies to radiation pressure acting on free electrons.  
    If only hydrogen is fully ionized, then there will typically be an enormous opacity due to ions heavier than hydrogen.
    In this project, led by PhD student Randall Dannen, we calculated the radiation force due to this 'line opacity'.
    We find that radiation forces can surpass gravity in sources emitting far below the Eddington limit, so that radiation driven
    outflows are expected to be commonplace in AGN.

- name: "Cloud coalescence"
  date: "2019"
  description: |
    The word 'coalescence' in astrophysics is typically used to describe one of the most energetic events in the universe: 
    the merging of binary compact objects such as black holes.  On the opposite end of the energy spectrum 
    is a purely gas dynamical process that causes astrophysical clouds to coalesce.  This occurence, uncovered 
    while exploring the nonlinear dynamics of interacting clouds formed from thermal instability,
    is shown to be a genuine instability that is generic to multiphase environments.

- name: "Non-isobaric thermal instability"
  date: "2019"
  description: |
    Thermal instability (TI) is a linear instability of non-adiabatic gas dynamics.  While the linear theory was thoroughly
    worked out in 1965 by George Field, in this work we clarified some subtleties that arise when clouds become very large, 
    meaning one side loses causal contact with the other (via communication through sound waves).  
    We identified 7 regimes of instability, as summarized in the Table at left, which reveals that very large wavelength sound waves
    do not even exist in an unstable plasma unless it is unstable by both the isobaric and isochoric instability criteria identified by Field.  
    The animations reveal that large (i.e. non-isobaric) clouds formed from TI tend to oscillate,
    and the cloud coalescence project above further demonstrates that such oscillations are also a generic property of multiphase gas
    dynamics.

    This project follows up <a href="http://www.physics.unlv.edu/astro/pw15sims.html" target="_blank">one led by Daniel Proga</a>, 
    where we laid some important ground work for several of the above projects, 
    as there we showed how to simulate cloud formation due to thermal instability while self-consistently accounting for the radiation force 
    that must become important as ions recombine. In this one we showed that adding flux variability can have interesting dynamical effects.  
    And in <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017MNRAS.467.3160W/abstract" target="_blank"> another followup paper</a>,
    we showed that common doublet lines can in principle be used to detect cloud acceleration along the line of sight.
