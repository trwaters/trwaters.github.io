# Tim Waters' Home Page

This is the code for [my personal website](https://trwaters.github.io) - a fork from [Yevgeniy Brikman's Home Page](httpsL//www.ybrikman.com)...actually, I forked [Robert Spurlin's fork](https://github.com/robertspurlin), as he already went to the trouble of deleting many things from Brikman's extensive site.  I have not deleted the blog, only suppressed the link to it.  In fact, I added Mathjax to it, as I may one day soon start a blog (I set this up in May 2020 after all while still quarantined at home).

1. Built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). This website is completely static
   and I use basic HTML or Markdown for everything.

   [GitHub Pages Gem](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/)
   and only Jekyll plugins that are
   [available on GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/repository-metadata-on-github-pages/).

1. The design is loosely based on [Kasper](https://github.com/rosario/kasper),
   [Pixyll](http://pixyll.com/), and [Medium](https://medium.com/).
1. I used [Basscss](http://www.basscss.com/), [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/),
   [Font Awesome Icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/),
   [Hint.css](http://kushagragour.in/lab/hint/),and
   [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts) for styling.
1. I used [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), [lazySizes](http://afarkas.github.io/lazysizes/),
   and [responsive-nav.js](http://responsive-nav.com/) for behavior.
1. I'm using [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) for monitoring and
   metrics.
